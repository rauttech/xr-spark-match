# XR Spark Match Mode - MVP Status Report

## 🎯 Project Goal
Build a WebXR MVP for "XR Spark Match Mode" on Meta Quest Browser, featuring floating profile cards, hand gestures, and compatibility "sparks".

## ✅ Completed Features (MVP)

| Feature | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project Setup** | ✅ Done | Vite + TypeScript + HTTPS + ESLint/Prettier configured. |
| **WebXR Core** | ✅ Done | `immersive-ar` session handling, `local-floor` reference space. |
| **Scene Rendering** | ✅ Done | Three.js scene, camera, lighting, and render loop. |
| **Card System** | ✅ Done | Floating profile cards spawned in 3D space. |
| **Match Engine** | ✅ Done | Mock logic calculating compatibility scores (0-100%). |
| **Spark Effect** | ✅ Done | Visual indicator (particle/color) for high-match profiles. |
| **Gestures** | ✅ Done | Basic hand tracking integration (placeholder logic for specific gestures). |
| **Testing** | ✅ Done | Unit tests (Vitest) and E2E tests (Playwright with Emulator support). |
| **CI/CD** | ✅ Done | GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing. |

## 🚧 Pending / Needs Improvement

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Card Visibility** | ✅ Done | High-resolution canvas textures implemented. |
| **Advanced Gestures** | ⏳ Basic | Complex gestures (Swipe/Pinch-Hold) are stubbed; needs refinement. |
| **Real Passthrough** | 🔮 Sim | Relies on device capabilities; currently using `dom-overlay`. |
| **Audio** | ✅ Done | AudioManager implemented with placeholder sounds. |
| **QR Scanning** | ⚠️ Proto | Prototype added; limited by WebXR privacy (must scan in 2D). |
| **Camera Research** | ✅ Done | Documented in `docs/camera_feasibility.md`. |

## 📋 Requirements Comparison

| Requirement | Implemented? | Verdict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WebXR / Quest Browser** | Yes | Fully compatible config. |
| **Floating Cards** | Yes | Implemented with `CardManager`. |
| **Hand Gestures** | Yes | `GestureEngine` is in place. |
| **Matchmaking Logic** | Yes | `MatchEngine` calculates scores. |
| **Visual "Spark"** | Yes | `SparkManager` handles effects. |
| **Premium UI** | Partial | Functional, but needs visual polish (resolution/contrast). |

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Enhance UI**: Increase resolution of card text and improve layout.
2. **Refine Gestures**: Tune sensitivity for pinch/drag interactions.
3. **Add Audio**: Integrate spatial audio for "Spark" events.
